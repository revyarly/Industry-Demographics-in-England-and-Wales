# Industry Demographics in England and Wales

The goal of this project was to focus on the Industry demographics of employed people in England and Wales. The project explores the relationship between various socio-economic aspects and Industries in a workplace population.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is taken from the 2011 census in England and Wales through the Nomis Website. Following datasets were used:

- Industry by Age
- Industry by Sex
- Industry by Economic Activity
- Industry by Occupation

## Tech Stack

**Programming Languages:** Python

**Tools:** Tableau, Excel

**Methods Used:** Data pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Data Projection

## Models

The Data Projection Algorithms used are:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

## Documentation

Here is the link to the [documentation](https://github.com/revyarly/Industry-Demographics-in-England-and-Wales/blob/main/documentation.pdf)


## Repository Structure

 - `src_code`: contains the code for the data  projections.
 - `documentation`: contains the indepth explanation of the processes and code.
 - `dashboards`: contains the occupation demographic dashboards

## Usage

To reproduce the predictions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the `.ipynb` file to produce data projections on the vast data. 
4. Run the `.twbx` file to visualise the dashboards 
   
## Conclusion

Successfully carried out a complete visual analytics project consisting of various phases from data preparation to data projections. By considering Munznerâ€™s task taxonomy, created interactive dashboards that helped users view, understand, and visualize the demographics of occupations in a workplace region of England and Wales.

Extensive visualisations and analysis have been done to find solutions to the socio-economic research problems stated at the report's beginning. In 2011, Birmingham and Leeds were the top economic centres that drew much attention amongst people from various industries regardless of gender and age. There was a lot of gender disparity in many industries. Especially the industries that required physical work were dominated heavily by men. The start-up/self-employment culture in 2011 was not as prevalent as it is now in 2022. 35-49 was the most common age group across all the industries. Professional and associate professional occupations were most popular back in 2011. An interactive dashboard has been created for the end-user to increase curiosity and find new insights. Projections were made using dimensionality reduction algorithms on the "Industry by Occupation" dataset.

These insights are only an overview of the demographics of occupation in England and Wales. The interactive dashboards allow users to explore more insights region-wise. In addition, two data projection algorithms are used to reduce the complexity of the data by implementing dimensionality reduction and explained the clusters formed in Tableau.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the demographics of industries in a workplace region of England and Wales. The interactive dashboards and data projections can help policymakers and researchers make informed decisions about workforce planning and development.
